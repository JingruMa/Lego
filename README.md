# Project Objective
Our dataset contains the LEGO Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories of every official LEGO set in the Rebrickable database. The data was collected on July 2017. LEGO is a popular brand of toy building bricks. They are often sold in sets which contains a number of parts in different shapes, sizes and colors. Each set can build a specific object such as gardens and cars. This database contains information on which parts are included in different LEGO sets. It was originally compiled to help people who owned some LEGO sets already figure out what other sets they could build with the pieces they had.
This is a pretty rich data. By analyzing the dataset, we are able to figure out the following questions
How have the size of sets changed over time?
What colors are associated with witch themes? Could you predict which theme a set is from just by the bricks it contains?
What sets have the most-used pieces in them? What sets have the rarest pieces in them?
Have the colors of LEGOs included in sets changed over time?

# Millstone 

  Week 4-5. <br />
  Data Cleaning. Since there is no mising values in this data, we do not need to figure out this problem. What we need to do is to put all data into one file and read the data in Python.
  <br /> Week 6-7. <br />
  Visualization and Summarization. 
  <br /> Week 8. <br />
  metrics (KPI) indicating progress, Hypothesis,feature,model.
  <br /> Week 9. <br />
  Model assessment.
